attribute: exitOnStandardFault
elements: process or scope
rules: when not specified, inheritance from enclosing scope along XML node hierarchy up to process. specifying the value breaks the inheritance chain.
default value: no in process only

attribute: suppressJoinFailure
elements: process and each activity
rules: same as exitOnStandardFault
default value: no in process only

attribute: queryLanguage
elements: process or query

def make attribute defaults explicit:
	apply XSD validation with parameter for default value filling
	persist xml with defaults

def make inherited attributes explicit:
	for all query with no queryLanguage attribute:
		copy process/@queryLanguage to query
	for all XXX with no expressionLanguage attribute:
		copy process/@expressionLanguage to XXX
	apply suppressJoinFailure
	apply exitOnStandardFault

def apply exitOnStandardFault:
	start with process
	store exitOnStandardFault from process
	depth first search for scopes:
		if scope has no exitOnStandardFault:
			copy stored exitOnStandardFault to scope
		else:
			store exitOnStandardFault from scope

def apply suppressJoinFailure:
     same as exitOnStandardFault having LIST OF ELEMENTS instead of scope
