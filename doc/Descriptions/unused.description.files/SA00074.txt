The expressions in <startCounterValue> and <finalCounterValue> MUST return a TII (meaning they contain at least one character) that can be validated as a xsd:unsignedInt. Static analysis MAY be used to detect this erroneous situation at design time when possible (for example, when the expression is a constant).
