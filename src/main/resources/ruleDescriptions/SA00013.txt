imported type differs from expected type
@@@
The value of the importType attribute of element <import> MUST be set to 
\\http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema when importing XML Schema 1.0 documents, and to http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/ when importing WSDL 1.1 documents.

Import-WrongImportType.bpel:
TestInterface.wsdl \texttt{<import>} has \texttt{importType='wrongImportType'} differing from the default \texttt{namespace='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/'}.

We were not able to get the type of an \texttt{<import>}, for each document, the same way.
Only files with default \texttt{namespace} as type definition can pass validation.
Apart from this the api is more abstract, than required.

It compares the \texttt{importType} with the default \texttt{namespace} of the root element, for each \texttt{<import>}.
The requirement for XML Schema 1.0 and WSDL 1.1 Documents are complied, because the algorithm includes them.
