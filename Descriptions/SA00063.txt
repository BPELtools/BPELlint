<onMessage> contains both @variable attribute and <fromPart> element
@@@
The semantics of the <onMessage> event are identical to a <receive> activity regarding the optional nature of the variable attribute or <fromPart> elements, if <fromPart>elements on an activity then the variable attribute MUST NOT be used on the same activity (see SA00055).

OnMessage-With-FromPartAndAttributeVariable.bpel:
BPEL-file with a \texttt{<onMessage>} Event containing a \texttt{<fromParts>} and \texttt{@variable}.
@@@
According to SA00063, a BPEL file is not valid if it contains \texttt{<onMessage>} 
element with a \texttt{<fromParts>} child element as well as a \texttt{variable} attribute.

The algorithm checks for the mere existence of the element and the attribute.
