Notification.bpel, Notification.wsdl:
One .wsdl with a \texttt{<operation name='notification'>} just containing an \texttt{<output>} in a separate PortType.

A .wsdl with a \texttt{<operation name='solicitResponse'>} containing an \texttt{<output>} followed by \texttt{<input>} in a separate PortType.

The rule SA00001 forbids the message exchange patterns solicit-response and notification for WSDL \texttt{<operation>}'s.
These patterns differ from the allowed one-way and request-response pattern by having the \texttt{<output>} element stated first.

The algorithm detects the message exchange pattern of a WSDL \texttt{<operation>} by looking at the children elements \texttt{<input>} and \texttt{<output>}.
