A link MUST NOT cross the boundary of a repeatable construct or the <compensationHandler> element. This means, a link used within a repeatable construct (<while>, <repeatUntil>, <forEach>, <eventHandlers>) or a <compensationHandler> MUST be declared in a <flow>that is itself nested inside the repeatable construct or <compensationHandler>.
