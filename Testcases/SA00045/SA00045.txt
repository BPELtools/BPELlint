SA00045 states that all \texttt{@properties} from a \texttt{<correlationSet>} must have a corresponding definition in the referenced XSD through a \texttt{<simpleType>}.

To navigate into the XML a detour through the WSDL over the corresponding \texttt{<property>} by its \texttt{type} attribute is needed.
