BPEL-file with a \texttt{<reply>} containing a \texttt{<toParts>} and an \texttt{@variable}.

According to SA00059, a BPEL file is not valid if it contains \texttt{<reply>} element with a \texttt{<toParts>} child element as well as a \texttt{variable} attribute.

The algorithm checks for the mere existence of the element and the attribute.
