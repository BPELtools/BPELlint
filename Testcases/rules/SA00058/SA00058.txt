In a <receive> or <reply> activity, the variable referenced by the variable attribute MUST be a messageType variable whose QName matches the QName of the input (for <receive>) or output (for <reply>) message type used in the operation, except as follows: if the WSDL operation uses a message containing exactly one part which itself is defined using an element, then a WS-BPEL variable of the same element type as used to define the part MAY be referenced by the variable attribute of the <receive> or <reply>activity.

$receiveReply = <receive> | <reply>

FOREACH $receiveReply
    FAIL UNLESS getQname(getVariable($receiveReply)) EQUALS getQname(getMessage($receiveReply))
