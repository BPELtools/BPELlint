NCNames must not contain dots according to SA00024. This is checked by getting the values of each \texttt{variable} attribute from all present \texttt{<onEvent>} elements as well as all \texttt{name} attributes from all \texttt{<variable>} elements. 

These are tested for occurences of at least one dot.
